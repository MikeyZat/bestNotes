###FINISHED###  EDIT:  Backend works again !

Someone inspired me to create 'To-do-List' available online, with great compatibility with both PC and mobile devices.
Technology stack:

Front-end:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS ES6
- ReactJS
- REST (XMLHttpRequest)


I am aware of my code being not of the best quality, but I was short of time due to much work at the University.
I just wanted to have it done and let it be useful for someone. I will pay more attention to the code quality in the future.

Big credits to https://github.com/Qizot for making a simple REST api in GoLang for me.
