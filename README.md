###FINISHED###

Someone inspired me to create 'To-do-List' available online, with great compatibility with both PC and mobile devices.
Technology stack:

Front-end:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS ES6
- ReactJS
- REST (XMLHttpRequest)

Back-end:
- Java 10 (Spring MVC, Spring REST)
- MySQL

Front-end will be deployed using heroku

Back-end stands on AWS

I am aware of my code being not of the best quality, but I was short of time due to much work at the University.
I just wanted to have it done and let it be useful for someone. I will pay more attention to the code quality in the future.

Live (although backend is not live :/ ) :
