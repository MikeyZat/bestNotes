Hi
Someone inspired me to create 'To-do-List' available online, with great compatibility with both PC and mobile devices.
Expected technology stack:
Front-end:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JS ES6
- ReactJS
- REST
Back-end:
- Java 10 (Spring mvc, Spring REST)
- MySQL or postgreSQL (will decide later)

All will be probably deployed using Heroku (since no commercial usage needed)

Project plan for front-end is rather simple, lets see what back-end brings.

Project in work...
